# My kitty config

This is my local config for the [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator.

## Install

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for the installation. The installer also downloads a custom font.

```bash
just install
```

Considering `kitty` is already installed, you can just run:

```bash
just config
```
